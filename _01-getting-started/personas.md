# Social Media Team Persona
"Well, now at least we have a process to share our social network accounts"

## Story
Julie manages the multiple social media accounts of her company. She works with a team of three rotating overqualified interns and while many people in the organization don’t really get the importance of her team she is pretty happy about her work. She have been told by her IT department that she needs to use passbolt to store the company social media credentials. So far they have been using a spreadsheet with restricted user access on google docs. She understand that the security of her current setup is far from optimal but dreads to have to teach everyone on how to use this new solution.

## Summary

* Manage her team password
* Manage her own password
### Key activities with the product

* The high turnover in her team makes it difficult for her if new tools are not super simple

# Small organization head / Unit Head - Persona
"Passbolt saved me from the headache of always searching for the same passwords and sharing them again and again with my team members. It boosted my productivity."

## Story
Jaap is the unique team lead of a web agency and handles a team of 15 web developers. Everyday he is wasting time because all the developers are working on multiple projects at a time, and they don’t manage to keep track of their passwords so they are asking him. He is always busy with dozen of tasks, so he is not particularly happy when these password requests add up. When it happens, he sends again the passwords on skype, or by email. Never on paper because he knows it’s unsecure. He wants a turnkey solution because he doesn’t have the time nor the means to install anything in his company’s network. He has tried some password managers available in the market but he thinks that they are not adapted for teams and he is not comfortable trusting a third party to handle such sensitive data. He wants the guarantee that he will remain in control.

## Summary
### End User ultimate goal(s) 
* Increase his own productivity as well as his team’s.
* Key activities with the product
* Organize passwords per projects, and share them with corresponding groups and users.
* Manage his own passwords
* Auto log in
### Limits & Pain Points
* He is confused with the asymmetric key system. He would like something more straightforward.
* One of his team member has already lost his key backup, and after reformatting the system was not able to access his password account anymore. He had to create a new passbolt account again and share everything with him back again.
### Ask strategy
* Adwords / Google / Search engines
* Word of mouth
* Access to the demo, and promote cloud offer through email or website.
* Give him one month free so he can start testing it with his team members and store some passwords.
### Marketing angle
* Talk about open source, privacy and control. 
* Talk about interoperable formats. They can export their passwords in PHP, keepassX format.
* Only if receptive:
** Self hosted version
** Slack integration, other available plugins

# IT Decision maker / Unit Head - Persona
"Passbolt helped me meet my security compliance checklist without crippling my budget and limited work from my staff."

## Story
Matthijs is the business head of 30+ staffed IT department that offers solutions in an organization that have multiple offices over the world. Matthijs does not have yet a password solution he can propose to his whole org. He is worried that since people do a little a bit what they want, it might lead to a security breach one day. Some of his users like himself uses Lastpass, his IT dept. staff are on Keypassx mostly, but he is more worried about the ones that are using post it notes or the one that use the same password everywhere. He is worried to have to commit some of his already strained internal resources to rollout an expensive solution. Ideally he would like this password solution to be integrated with the expensive identity management solution he is rolling out.

## Summary
### End User ultimate goal(s) 
* Increase the security standards of his organization with minimum cost, e.g. reduced trainings, support, maintenance, licence costs, etc.
* Key activities with the product
* Set and monitor password policy compliance (rotation, complexity, changes when somebody leaves the org. etc.)
* View how many people are using the products and their satisfaction level
* Manage his own passwords

* branding and customization opportunities
* Only if receptive:
