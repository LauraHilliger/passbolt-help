  - question: Why does my organisation need a password manager?
    answer: A password manager allows you to comfortably implement best security practices and therefore reduces the risks for you and your organisation. With a password manager you can prevent your team from reusing the same password on multiple systems. You can also make sure they generate stronger passwords by default, since they do not have to remember them anymore. It also makes it easier to rotate credentials, e.g. help you change your passwords regularly, every 40 days for example. Additionally, having an overview of who has access to what, allows you to reset passwords when somebody leaves your organisation. Reciprocally it can also help facilitate when someone is joining your team, since a new member can easily be given access to the all the password they need. It also prevents loss of credentials since you can perform backups.
  - question: Is sharing the same password with multiple users a bad practice?
    answer: Indeed, it is. Wherever possible you should try to have one user account and a unique password per person. However it is not always possible, especially for built-in privileged accounts (like the admin password of a router, a root password on a linux server, your organization instagram / twitter account password, etc.), and this is where passbolt can be of most help.
  - question: I need a personal password manager, can passbolt help me?
    answer: Yes. You can also use passbolt to store those passwords that you do not want to share with anyone.
