1. 	Make sure you Firefox version is up to date. We only support the most recent versions.  
2. 	Go to [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passbolt/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passbolt/)
3.  Click on the "Add to Firefox" button
4.  Wait until the add-on download is complete
5.  Click install
6.  A passbolt icon should now be visible

### I did this, but it still does not work!

Sometimes Firefox does not behave as expected and passbolt will not start. We are aware of the problem and are trying to fix it. In the meantime here is what you try:

*   Press F5 / refresh the page.
*   Close firefox and restart it again.
*   Remove the firefox extension and reinstall it again.

If you are still experiencing issues after trying these options out, feel free to get in touch, we would be happy to know more.
