            <p>
                This release is mainly about shipping some of the missing "groups" features such as the email notifications.
                You will also find a few bug fixes, and an improvement in the default email configuration for those of you who use TLS authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was also the occasion to update our <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/passbolt/passbolt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">docker container</a>. We fixed a few bugs and added email support.
            </p>
            <p>
                A big thank to all of you who tested and reported bugs for this release, especially Klugemara and Tomasz Kontusz.
