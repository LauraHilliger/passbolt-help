##Code of conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all of us: Passbolt staff, contributors, maintainers and participants in any campaigns, projects, and communities under the Passbolt name.


We expect this Code of Conduct to be followed in any ticketing system, social network, forum, mailing list, IRC channel, wiki, web site, private correspondence, online and offline event or meeting.

###Anti-harassment policy

We pledge to respect everyone who contributes to this project in any way.

We welcome contributions from everyone regardless of geographical location, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, disability, physical appearance, sexual orientation and religious views.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Personal attacks, hate speech, trolling, baiting, spamming, any intentional form of discrimination, unwelcome sexual attention or imagery, deliberate intimidation, physical threats, stalking or any other kind of bad behaviour will be dealt with decisively.

Offenders will be temporarily or permanently banned from communicating through Passbolt's systems and events or otherwise penalised. These rules may be enforced at the discretion of Passbolt staff by removing issues, comments, blocking or reporting accounts and banning from online or public meetings. 

###Interaction principles

We pledge to adhere to following principles when interacting with each other:

'''Be respectful''': there will always be people with whom we may disagree or find it difficult to cooperate. We will, however, take a deep breath if we need to and then remain respectful.


'''Agree to disagree''': decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities and there are many ways of reaching our common goals. If we disagree, we will do so politely.


'''Assume good faith''': when we disagree we do not assume the worst, it is unlikely a participant is intentionally trying to degrade the quality of a discussion or product. We will assume best intentions in our interactions.


'''Welcome other perspectives''': we actively seek to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. We empower others to speak and will strive to make diversity and inclusion intentional. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.


'''Be concise''': we try to be concise and avoid repeating what has already been said. We try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.


'''Be transparent''': we are open about what we are working on to allow others to participate. We are also transparent about our mistakes to allow others to
learn and avoid repeating them.
