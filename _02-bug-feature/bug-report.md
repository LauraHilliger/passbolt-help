# How to file a bug

If you have ever seen a piece of software that functions exactly as it's supposed to 100% of the time...nevermind, that is an improbable dream. We work hard to squash the bugs in passbolt, so if you find something not quite right, please file an issue on our github repo.

# Reporting a security Issue

If you've found a security related issue in Passbolt, please don't open an issue in GitHub.
Instead contact us at security@passbolt.com. In the spirit of responsible disclosure we ask that the reporter keep the
issue confidential until we announce it.

The passbolt team will take the following actions:
* Try to first reproduce the issue and confirm the vulnerability.
* Acknowledge to the reporter that we?ve received the issue and are working on a fix.
* Get a fix/patch prepared and create associated automated tests.
* Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
* Release new versions of all affected major versions.
* Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement.
* Provide credits in the release announcement to the reporter if they so desire.

# Reporting a bug
Please only use github for bugs or pull request.

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt/issues)
* Check first that a similar issue does not already exist.
* Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue if it is a bug.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug
